# Telling The Story
{: .no_toc }

Reclaimers is a game fundamentally about telling a story. To tell this story smoothly Reclaimers is generally split into 4 distinct phases of gameplay: 
* [Narrative-Time](Game/Core/Narrative-Time)
* [Combat](Game/Core/Combat)
* [Deployment](Game/Deployment)
* [Returning-From-Space](Game/Returning-From-Space)

A session should begin with [Deployment](Game/Deployment) flowing into [Narrative-Time](Game/Core/Narrative-Time) and [Combat](Game/Core/Combat) until the situation is resolved, at which point the [Characters](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) will be [Returning-From-Space](Game/Returning-From-Space).
