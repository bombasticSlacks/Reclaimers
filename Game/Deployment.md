# Deployment
{: .no_toc }

Anytime you leave the planet for a mission, this is called deployment. When on deployment, you represent the [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov), and should follow [The Rules Of The Reclaimers](Game/Lore#The%20Rules%20Of%20The%20Reclaimers).

## Deploying
During deploying is a great time to jump into [Narrative-Time](Game/Core/Narrative-Time) and role-play interactions between the team, or flashback / montage what each [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character) has been doing since last deployment.

When deploying, you will do a few useful things.
* Be briefed on what information [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) has on the mission and situation.
* Be informed of the [Severity](#Severity) of the mission.
* [Requisition](#Requisition) gear.
* Depart for your target location, starting [Narrative-Time](Game/Core/Narrative-Time).


### Severity
Missions are generally classified with 4 levels of severity.

#### Level 0 (Appearance)
Level 0 missions represent what would be considered a formal appearance or obligation for the Reclaimers. Escorting a dignitary, attending a parade, evaluating a new station. A level 0 mission should have no real expectation of combat or hostility.

#### Level 1 (Mystery)
Level 1 missions represent some worry and intrigue. Reclaimers can expect to meet some hostility or roadblocks resolving whatever underlying issues are at the location.

#### Level 2 (Catastrophe)
Level 2 missions represent a full-blown catastrophe. Reclaimers will be in life-threatening situations and have to act fast to maintain order.

#### Level 3 (Apocalypse)
Level 3 missions represent a complete breakdown of the target area. Reclaimers will be all that is standing between the end of the station.

### Requisition
Once you understand the severity and have the details, you can requisition gear.
Your [Origin](Game/Creating-A-Reclaimer#Origin) will explain what gear you have access to, and each piece will specify a requisition cost. 

Your total number of available requisition points is equal to your [Sway](Game/Additional-Attributes#Sway) + [Severity](#Severity).

> So a character with 2 [Sway](Game/Additional-Attributes#Sway) on a level 1 mission could requisition 3 points. If they were military, they could depart with a: [Vibro-CQW](Game/Blocks/Vibro-CQW) (2 points), [Handgun](Game/Blocks/Handgun) (0 points), [Plate-Carrier](Game/Blocks/Plate-Carrier) (0 points), and [IFAK](Game/Blocks/IFAK) (1 point)


#### Multiple Requisitions
You can opt to take multiples of any [Equipment](Game/Core/Equipment) that costs at least 1 requisition.

#### Comestibles
Unless specified, you deploy with one of each [Comestibles](Game/Core/Gear#Comestibles), however you may replenish them when used from your [Supplies](Game/Blocks/Supplies).
