# Unborn
{: .no_toc }

Unborn (ʌnˈbɔːn) are generally human animal hybrids and widely the name given to any sentient creatures born out of genetic experiment. Spoken clearer, anybody who is "unborn". Many of these people come from excavation of prewar labs where experimentation ran wild and ethics was of no concern. The Unborn are those that have been freed and reintegrated as [Citizens](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Citizen). The Unborn behave similarly to other humans with a few small differences, first they have a much stronger sense of personal property than most [Citizens](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Citizen) and can be territorial. An Unborn's increased genetic affinity makes them appealing for a mixture of labour-intensive and meticulous jobs.
