# Creating A Reclaimer
{: .no_toc }

To create a Reclaimer, you must answer some questions:

## Details
Before anything else, try to imagine what your character should be. Are they from a specific [culture or race](Game/Cultures-And-Races)? Tall? What colour is their hair? Do they have any unique traits? These are the kinds of questions that will help fill out your character. None of this will have any bearing on your characterâ€™s abilities, but it could influence them.

You should have an answer for these things before continuing:
1. What is your name?
2. What did you do before becoming a Reclaimer?
3. What great thing got you inducted into the Reclaimers?

## Grab A Character Sheet
If you would like to use one, a [Character-Sheet](Game/Content/Character-Sheet.svg) is provided.


## Origin
Reclaimers, no matter the variety in their backgrounds, always have some form of origin. These groups follow specific training regiments and have access to specific sets of [Equipment](Core/Equipment).

Select one of the following and continue there:
* [Agent](Game/Agent)
* [Medic](Game/Medic)
* [Mystic](Game/Mystic)
* [Psych](Game/Psych)
* [Sleuth](Game/Sleuth)
* [Soldier](Game/Soldier)
* [Tech](Game/Tech)

## Determine Your Attributes
*Even before you became a Reclaimer, you were gifted, additional cybernetics and training have further increased that power.*

Assign your [Attributes](Game/Core/Attributes) with values of 4, 3, 3, 2, and 2.

> So, 4 [Strength](Core/Strength), 3 [Agility](Core/Agility), 3 [Intelligence](Core/Intelligence), 2 [Spirit](Core/Spirit), 2 [Communication](Core/Communication) is a valid set of attributes.

## Distinguishing Characteristic
Something about you makes you the best of the best. Roll a 12 sided dice to determine what that is, your character starts with this additional benefit.
