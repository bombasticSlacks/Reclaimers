# Creating A Reclaimer
{: .no_toc }

To create a Reclaimer, you must answer some questions:

## Details
Before anything else, try to imagine what your character should be. Are they a specific race? Tall? What colour is their hair? Do they have any unique traits? These are the kinds of questions that will help fill out your character. None of this will have any bearing on your characterâ€™s abilities, but it could influence them.

You should have an answer for these things before continuing:
1. What is your name?
2. Were you ever in the military? What did you do?
3. What great thing got you inducted into the Reclaimers?

## Determine Your Attributes
*Even before you became a Reclaimer, you were gifted, additional cybernetics and training have further increased that power.*

Assign your [Attributes](Game/Core/Attributes) placing one of the two sets of values in each of the 5 attributes.
* 4,3,2,2,2
* 3,3,3,2,2

> So, 4 [Strength](Core/Strength), 3 [Agility](Core/Agility), 2 [Intelligence](Core/Intelligence), 2 [Spirit](Core/Spirit), 2 [Communication](Core/Communication) is a valid set of attributes.

## Roll For Bonus
#TODO add a table with like 8-12 possibilities for rewards you have to start the game with.



## Archetype
Reclaimers, no matter the variety in their backgrounds, always loosely fit into an archetype category. These groups follow specific training regiments and have access to specific sets of [Equipment](Core/Equipment).

Select one of the following and continue there:
* [Detective](Detective)
* [Engineer](Engineer)
* [Military](Military)
* [Occultist](Occultist)
* [Paramedic](Paramedic)
* [Psychiatrist](Psychiatrist)
* [Researcher](Researcher)
* [Spook](Spook)

## Equipment
Your character will not begin play with any [Equipment](Core/Equipment), when you go on [Deployment](Deployment) you will be provided with equipment based on [Archetype](#Archetype) and mission [Severity](Deployment#Severity).
