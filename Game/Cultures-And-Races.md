# Cultures And Races
{: .no_toc }

The [Earth](Game/Earth) and [Space](Game/Space) are places of many groups and wonders, however some of the major groups represented throughout space are listed here. 

## Cultural Bonuses
Some cultures or races will mention affinity for certain things or naturally seem inclined for certain types of work on a population level. These affinities provide no direct bonuses to a Reclaimer, who will instead select attributes based on their background rather than racial biases. A brilliant [Kaar](Game/Kaar) scientist or a militant [Envoy](Game/Envoy) officer are exactly the sorts of interesting opinions and experiences the Reclaimers want.

Some [Cultures-And-Races](Game/Cultures-And-Races) will have [Specialization](Game/Progress#Specialization) or other [Advancements](Game/Progress#Advancements) that are culturally significant to them, **you do not need to adhere to, or belong to a culture to gain their advancements**, technology, otherworldly influence, and the sharing of knowledge can bridge the gap.
