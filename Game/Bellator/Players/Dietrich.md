## Details
Dietrich is a tall, bony woman with pale skin, sharp features, high cheekbones, and a large, hooked nose. Her hair is thin, pin straight, and jet black, and her eyes are grey-blue, with perpetually small pupils. She wears a stern expression by default.

Most notable about her appearance is the small black feathers protruding sporadically from her skin like freckles down her arms and legs, and clustered thickly over her back.

Part of a [Foreign Affairs](Game/Government#Foreign%20Affairs), good at "collecting" information. 

## Side Stories
Dietrich has been studying Xeno Biology.
