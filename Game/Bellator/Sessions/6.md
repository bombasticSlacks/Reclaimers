# 6: Godzilla Theme
{: .no_toc }

## Ideas
The Reclaimers need to disrupt some misaligned science happening in a Barons homestead. The locals are creating a powerful bioweapon in secret that they might lose control of.

### Message
"Wartime Contraband Shipments" from Baron Hahn's Estate. Going to take a tour as CentGov emissaries, investigate while there.

Baron, though not a member of CentGov, is a large provider to the space backbone. Need to be careful not to upset him unless something is truly wrong.
