Message of "No Signal" from station IX408, an unknown station which has been flagged for processing by a small crew.

Mission Rating: [Level 2 (Catastrophe)](Game/Deployment#Level%202%20(Catastrophe))

## People
### Skittery
A fast rat with the ability to teleport himself and other people.

In Recreation.

Had to race through mazes to find food.

### Jittery
A paranoid rat with the ability to make people hear and see things that aren't there.

In Medical.

Was subjected to strange projections.

### Bittery
An bitter rat looking to get payback for what was done to him. Can control electric systems.

In Maintenance.

Managed the station where all of this torture took place.

### Chittery
A violent (joyfully so) rat who is a reflection of his environment. Can perform acts of pychokenesis.

In Security.

Was forced to fight other rats to the death to become the "strongest".

## Hooks
* Going to arrive and immediately doors will be blocked off with the "AI" saying they don't have access.
* Be propositioned into Recreation by Skittery, who will have created a maze like construct in Recreation.
* Pressure them by Bittery trying to kill them, or "evict them" as the bad men.
* Fight arena in Security.
* The rat king is in Maintenance, even more powerful if they make the other rats hate them somehow with additional powers.
* Medical is a clean room with strange, distorted projections.
* Ghost projections of the torture that happened to them throughout from Jittery.
* Harrass with blocking and stuff by Bittery.
* Need to solve a riddle from the other 3 rats to be let into maintenance. "What are the three things everybody needs"
	* Food - Skittery
	* Company - Chittery
	* Hope - Jittery
* There won't be a timer, but bittery will be reviewing the situation as it unfolds, threatening them if they try to cheat.
* Rats are weak to fire and pierce. Deal impact and rending damage.
* Skittery
	* Solve the maze.
	* Make him food or something, maybe (gain his trust).
	* Make him like them, he's the ally in the session.
* Chittery
	* Prove strength in the arena.
	* Drink the primordial soup (rat gunk melted down with the bio destabilizer) will cause illness / rage potentially.
	* Avoid the bio destabilizer that he has access to. (charged item that as an action deals 1 damage and if it injures kills something instantly for 1 point).
* Jittery
	* Figure out where he is stuck by watching the memories and interrogating them.
	* Try to find the happy memories for Jittery.
	* Put the other rats to rest (send them to space).
## Notes
* Ken failed to hack the PC [Bittery](#Bittery) deleted relevant logs and let them in.
* "lab gear" was delivered every 4 weeks until 2 months ago.
* Figured it was coalition station.
* in sec 3 left doors (big), 12 doors on right (small).
* ~~Dire Rat - 12 integrity weak heat and pierce. Attack (6, Rend, 6), Knockover.~~
* [Dietrich](Game/Bellator/Players/Dietrich) taking the rats with her.
