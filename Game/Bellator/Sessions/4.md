# 4: Unholy Trinity
{: .no_toc }

## Ideas
A terrible red fog has been unleashed from an ancient tomb. The tomb was sealed with a mark in 3 - 4 pieces and split among researchers, soldiers, labourers. Make them go crazy making augmented bioweapons, cannibals etc.

## Message
3 identical warnings of "Mutiny" from each of the 3 groups.
Level 3 Apocalypse.

## Hooks
* Can only be outside for a minute before poison buildup from atmosphere.
* The sound is coming from the interior chamber which was sealed away before. Need to get the markers to seal it again.
* On the wall will be 1 symbol with three worn away beside it with time "â¬¤" which translates to "ALL".
* The triangle was split,
	* Researchers took the left for study - it was covered in a film like substance.
	* Engineering took the right for study - do material processing on it.
	* Security took the top for study - it was producing a strange signal they wanted to use decoders on.
* The groups fell to chaos,
	* Researchers started melding people together to create abominations.
	* Engineering has become a living machine made of strange warped metal.
	* Security has fallen to canibalism trying to find the sound inside others.
* When the players arrive everyone will imediately make an identity test.
	* Anyone who fails can make an identity test to deal +1 damage on any attack.
* There will be a slight redness to everyones vision.
* Cecilia has become the ooze doctor, and has transformed her team into monsters.
* Soldiers will be able to maybe be snapped out of it.
* Engineers will be potentially rescuable (in R2 with horrible machinery to deal with)
* Engineer hab will shift, you only can access one room from each portion of the hall.
* The temple itself will have stronger fog, requiring a solution to push inward.
