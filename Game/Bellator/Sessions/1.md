* Cryopod in cargo bay with [Shock-Trooper](Game/Creatures/Shock-Trooper). Stali will try to release if they seem to be getting close.
* Too many boxes to easily sort all of cargo, even with manifests it will take time to discover an anomaly. Stali will draw them to the captain if they start this train of thought.

* Bell will be monitoring their progress on cameras and mics.
* Combat Drones will go haywire and attack them.
