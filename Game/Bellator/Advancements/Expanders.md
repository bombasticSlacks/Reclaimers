### Expanders
*Your weapon is loaded with ammo that causes additional internal damage expanding as it contacts enemies.*
* When [Loading](Game/Core/Blocks/Loading) a weapon, you may spend a [Supplies](Game/Blocks/Supplies) and declare you are loading expanders. Until the weapon is reloaded, it has the [Injuring](Game/Core/Blocks/Injuring) trait.
