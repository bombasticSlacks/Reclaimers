# Important People
{: .no_toc }

Characters of note on the planet of earth.

## Governor Yang
The leader of the [WesCan](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#WesCan) [Dome](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Dome). An imposingly tall woman with long brown hair pulled into a bun wearing a black [Jumpsuit](Game/Blocks/Jumpsuit). In public, she wears a necklace of honour given to her for bravery while serving in the [Navy](Game/Government#Navy). She is almost superfluously warm, but quick to damn those who fail.

## High Commander Doron
The leader of the [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) [Military](Game/Government#Military). An ancient man composed mostly of machinery. Doron has outlived so many officials and position changeovers in government, no one is at this point certain how old he is; some suggest he was military before the last war. Sharp but slow to speak, Doron's imposing shape imposes authority on those around him.
