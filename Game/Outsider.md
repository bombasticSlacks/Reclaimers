# Outsider
{: .no_toc }

Outsider ([ˌaʊtˈsaɪdə](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)) is the general classification for all the communities surviving outside the [Domes](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Dome) on [Earth](Game/Earth). When discovered and if willing, these communities will be offered citizenship and integrated into [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov). They are a resilient group covering a multitude of tribes and loose hierarchies that somehow, to this day, survived the nuclear apocalypse of earth or hellscapes of other planets. They have a strong sense of family and unity, lending to them usually immigrating into a [Dome](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Dome) without much difficulty.

Traditionalists tend to look like modern humans, with minor to major deformations and irregularly coloured skin (usually from radiation burns).
