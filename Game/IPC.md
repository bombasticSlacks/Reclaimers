# IPC
{: .no_toc }

IPC (aɪ piː siː) or Integrated Positronic Chassis is the classification for the robots housing advanced positronic brains. These robots were, before the great war, kept as slaves with no consideration for their sentience by large corporations that owned them. Before the war broke out, they began to fight for their rights and created workers unions. With the advent of [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) it is no longer necessary to maintain these unions, but IPC tend to be proud of their history. 

Their robotic bodies are humanoid, with their important systems in their chest cavity. Their head is a large monitor which can display images and words as needed. IPC struggle to feel emotion as humans do and more so emulate it after forming relationships with others, though some may argue this is indistinguishable from feeling emotion.
