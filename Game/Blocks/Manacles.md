#### Manacles

_A set of restraints. Designed using modern materials, making escape nearly impossible._

- Traits: [Charges](Game/Core/Terminology#Charges)([Munition Capacity](Game/Blocks/Munition-Capacity)), [Unskilled](Game/Core/Blocks/Unskilled).
- Spend 1 charge on a [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) or [Stunned](Game/Core/Effects#Stunned) character to make them [Restrained](Game/Core/Effects#Restrained).
- During a [Grapple](Game/Core/Special-Combat-Actions#Grapple) make a [Physique](Game/Core/Strength#Physique) [Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(-2) to spend 1 charge and make the grappled [Restrained](Game/Core/Effects#Restrained).
- You can collect the restraints from someone you have restrained to regain 1 charge.
