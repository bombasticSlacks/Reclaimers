### Playing God
*Your medical knowledge pushes past what many would consider impossible. You can bring back from the brink of death, or beyond, even the most hopeless.*
* You cannot have [Critical Failure](Game/Core/Skills#Critical%20Failure) on any medical related [Skill Tests](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test).
* You can perform surgery on someone within 10 minutes of their death to bring them back to life. This test is at a penalty based on the severity of the damage.
