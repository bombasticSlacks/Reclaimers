#### All Access Pass
*A black sheet that feels similar to paper in your hands. When held by a trained person and presented with confidence, it appears to be any form, or authentication someone else might expect you to have. The incredible thing about this device is you don't even need to know what it is the other party expects, the object itself will know.*
* Traits: [Unskilled](Game/Core/Blocks/Unskilled)
* You may show the All Access Pass to another [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) who is expecting some form of paperwork, badge, or other documentation and they will believe you have it.
