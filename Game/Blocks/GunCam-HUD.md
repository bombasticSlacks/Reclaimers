### GunCam HUD
*A combination of a camera to attach to your weapon and a heads-up display program. This lets you fire “blind” around corners without exposing your head.*
* You can perform [Ranged Attacks](Core/Terminology#Ranged%20Attack) at only a (-1) penalty while [In Cover](Core/Effects#In%20Cover) and making it impossible for [Characters](Core/Terminology#Character) to target you.
