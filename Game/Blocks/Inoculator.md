#### Inoculator
*A high-tech device designed to investigate illness / disease and produce panacea. With enough time, a character can use an inoculator to create a cure for any illness or disease.*
* Traits: [Toolkits](Game/Core/Blocks/Toolkits), [Skilled](Game/Core/Blocks/Skilled)([Application](Game/Core/Intelligence#Application)).
* If you have a sample of a disease or illness, you can create a cure or vaccine for it. Depending on the origin of the illness, it may be too late for those already infected, but others can be vaccinated.
