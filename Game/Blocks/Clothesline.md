### Clothesline
*Someone running at you has never been a problem.*
* If an [Opponent](Game/Core/Terminology#Opponent) moves within [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) of you, you may spend a [Reaction](Game/Core/Reacting#Reaction) to make a [Physique](Game/Core/Strength#Physique)[Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0), that if successful, ends their [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) and makes them [Prone](Game/Core/Effects#Prone).

> So the skill test would be at a (-4) penalty against someone with 2 ranks in [Physique](Game/Core/Strength#Physique).
