#### Stasis Injector
*An injector full of a quick acting serum leaving a target locked in a stasis locking their injuries and state in equilibrium for a few hours. This provides someone time to bring a near hopeless patient to a medical facility where they can receive proper care.*

* Traits: [Comestibles](Game/Core/Gear#Comestibles), [Unskilled](Game/Core/Gear#Unskilled).
* As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) you may inject a [Compliant](Game/Core/Terminology#Compliant) [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) with the [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) effect. Until [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) is removed, none of their injuries get worse, and they cannot die except by extreme damage.
