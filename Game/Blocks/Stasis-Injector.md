#### Stasis Injector
*A syringe full of a quick acting serum leaving a target locked in a stasis locking their injuries and state in equilibrium for a few hours. This provides someone time to bring a near hopeless patient to a medical facility where they can receive proper care.*

* This is a [Comestible](Game/Core/Comestibles).
* As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) you may inject a [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) with the [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) effect, or who is otherwise [Compliant](Game/Core/Terminology#Compliant). Until [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) is removed, none of their injuries get worse, and they cannot die except by extreme damage.
