#### Causality Fans
*A strange pair of incredibly lethal decorative fans reinforced with a strange black metal and fabric that seems to shift and warp as they move through space. With proper practice, a skilled user can summon these from out of thin air and use them to brutal effectiveness.*

* At the start of combat, and as a free action on each of your turns you roll 1d6 to determine what traits the fans have from the following:

| Roll | Description | [Weapon-Traits](Game/Core/Weapon-Traits) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The fans levitate on their own protecting you as best they can. | [Shield(2)](Game/Core/Blocks/Shield) |
| 2 | The fans stretch and bend through space. | [On Line](Game/Core/Blocks/On-Line) |
| 3 | The fans feel heavy as though their impacts will be massive. | [Mass](Game/Core/Blocks/Mass) |
| 4 | The fans have grown thin and seem to writhe like roots. | [Precision](Game/Core/Blocks/Precision) |
| 5 | The fans seem incorporeal, almost passing through solid objects. | [Penetrating](Game/Core/Blocks/Penetrating) |
| 6 | The fans end in strange clawed hooks that seems to grab and pull at clothing and armour. | [Sundering](Game/Core/Blocks/Sundering) |
