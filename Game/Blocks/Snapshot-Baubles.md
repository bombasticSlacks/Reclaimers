#### Snapshot Baubles
*Advanced spheres that can be deployed to provide full details of an area to your HUD.*
* [Traits](Game/Core/Gear#Traits): [Comestibles](Game/Core/Gear#Comestibles).
* When activated, a snapshot bauble scans everything within a [Short](Game/Core/Movement#Short) distance. This provides full 360 degree detail of the area.
* Snapshots can be displayed on [Heads-Up-Display](Game/Blocks/Heads-Up-Display).
* Snapshots can be superimposed onto areas, allowing you and others to interact with the imposition through AR processing.
