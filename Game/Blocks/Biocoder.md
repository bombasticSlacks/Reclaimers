#### Biocoder
*A disturbing needle pointed glove oozing with strange fluids that seem to be secreted from your body. This device is used to temporarily disrupt the genetic makeup of those around you in strange and incredible ways.*
* This device requires performing [Attunement](Game/Core/Spirit#Attunement) [Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test). On failure, you and the target suffer a [Stress](Game/Stress). On a [Critical Failure](Game/Core/Skills#Critical%20Failure) the target also suffers a [Severe Injury](Game/Core/Injury#Severe%20Injury).
* As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) you can modify someone within [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) with some small boon or malady until the end of the [Scene](Game/Core/Terminology#Scene).
* With a few minutes, you can drastically alter a willing character or characters with a new property that last until the end of deployment, or until you create another drastic change.
> So, during combat you could cause someone's muscles to grow giving them +1 [Strength](Game/Core/Strength), or with some time, you could imbue yourself and your allies with fish gills.
