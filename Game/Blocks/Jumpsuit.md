#### Jumpsuit
*[CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) citizens wear a standardized jumpsuit made of advanced synthetic materials and sprayed with ablative foam for additional protection. These tend to be colour coded based on occupation, see [Fashion](Game/Earth#Fashion)*.

* A Reclaimer can wear any colour they choose, but most prefer to wear the colour of their original occupation, green, or black.
