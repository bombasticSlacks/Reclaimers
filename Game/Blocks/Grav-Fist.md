#### Grav Fist
*The pinnacle of destruction. This large mechanical glove and rigging is used by shock troopers to devastate large creatures, vehicles and bulkheads. The Fist itself is a polymer reinforced, servo-powered glove two to three times the size of a normal hand with a power pack installed. On command a power field is activated causing widespread damage. To combat Newton's third law, at the moment of impact, a gravity controller increases the user's weight dramatically.*
