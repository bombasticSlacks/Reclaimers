### Vermin Speaker
*You have a heightened connection with your primitive side, allowing you an increased telepathic connection to vermin, rodents, and other scavengers.*
* You may summon any nearby vermin to you with [Attunement](Game/Core/Spirit#Attunement).
* You may give instruction or question vermin similarly with [Attunement](Game/Core/Spirit#Attunement). With convincing, these instructions may even put the vermin in harms way
