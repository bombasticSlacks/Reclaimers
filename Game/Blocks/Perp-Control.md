### Perp Control
*You are used to controlling criminals and escorting them out of hot environments.*
* Any [Restrained](Game/Core/Effects#Restrained) [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character), if not controlled by [The Players](Game/Core/How-To-Play#The%20Players), becomes a [Follower](Game/Core/Terminology#Follower) for you. They don't count towards your follower limit and may move even though they are [Restrained](Game/Core/Effects#Restrained).
