### Reassuring Shout
*You've got a way with people, especially those on the brink of death, making sure they have faith.*
* When someone is [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) you may use a [Reaction](Game/Core/Reacting#Reaction) to remove their [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) effect. This does not require a [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test).
