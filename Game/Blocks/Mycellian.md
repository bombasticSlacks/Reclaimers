### Mycellian
*You have small fibres coming off every part of your body which you leave on objects you touch lasting a few moments before withering to nothing.*
* If you die for any reason, you may regrow yourself anywhere you have been in the last few moments. This process takes a few minutes.
* You automatically remove [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) at the end of combat or at the end of each [Scene](Game/Core/Terminology#Scene).
* You regrow any lost limbs within a few minutes.
