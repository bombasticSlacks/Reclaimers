### Backpack Ammo Supply
*You have a massive backpack ammo supply, providing one of your weapons with an almost unending amount of ammo.*
* Select a [Weapon](Core/Weapons) you [Deployed](Deployment) with, remove the [Capacity](Game/Core/Blocks/Capacity) and [Loading](Game/Core/Blocks/Loading) traits if it has them. 
* Some narrative effects or true abuse may cause your weapon to still run out of ammo, but it should be handled with your [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master).
