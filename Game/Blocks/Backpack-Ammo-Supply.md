### Backpack Ammo Supply
*You have a massive backpack ammo supply, providing one of your weapons with an almost unending amount of ammo.*
* Select a [Weapon](Core/Weapons) you [Deployed](Deployment) with, remove the [Capacity(X, Type)](Core/Weapon-Traits#Capacity(X,%20Type)) and [Loading(X)](Core/Weapon-Traits#Loading(X)) traits if it has them. 
* Some narrative effects or true abuse may cause your weapon to still run out of ammo, but it should be handled with your [GM](Core/How-To-Play#GM).
