#### Censer
*Originally a handheld religious relic used to burn and distribute incense, war priests would modify them to distribute empowering chemicals to their allies and, depending on the rules of engagement, poison to their enemies. This was standardized into a tool for mass distribution of airborne drugs.*
* Must have a free hand to be used.
* You may expend one [Comestibles](Game/Core/Gear#Comestibles) that contains a drug or other airborne effect to distribute it around yourself. Anyone who comes within [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) of you becomes affected by the used [Comestibles](Game/Core/Gear#Comestibles). This area surrounding you persists until the end of the [Scene](Game/Core/Terminology#Scene).
