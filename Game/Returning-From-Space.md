# Returning From Space

{: .no_toc }

## Baseline Test

_The first thing that will be done once you arrive at a [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) building will be an evaluation of your mental state. This will check how much the mission has affected you._

Increase your [Exhaustion](Game/Blocks/Exhaustion) if any of the following has happened (note, you always gain at least 1 exhaustion):

| Event                                                      | Increase |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Time moves forward                                         | +1       |
| Another Reclaimer Was [Wounded](Game/Core/Effects#Wounded) | +1       |
| You were [Wounded](Game/Core/Effects#Wounded)              | +2       |
| Reached your max [Stress](Game/Blocks/Stress)              | +2       |
| Another Reclaimer Died                                     | +3       |
| Failed Your Mission                                        | +3       |

### Retiring

When your character reaches their [Exhaustion](Game/Blocks/Exhaustion) value they can go on one more [Deployment](Game/Deployment) but then are expected to retire. When your character retires they are no longer playable, however when creating a replacement for your retiree they may start with a piece of gear your old character had access to as a [Trophy](#Trophy), and when determining your [Distinguishing Characteristic](Game/Creating-A-Reclaimer#Distinguishing%20Characteristic) you may roll twice and use the result you prefer.

## Medical Recovery

_[CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) has the greatest facilities imaginable, if they can scrape you off the walls and get you in a cryopod you can be saved at central government._

Any injuries you suffered while on [Deployment](Game/Deployment) are fixed. You may choose if this process alters you in some way.

> If you lost an arm, you could choose to either have your original arm regrown, a robotic one, a clear prosthetic, if it leaves scarring etc.

## Reprimand

_If any Reclaimers were reported to have been abusive of their fellow citizens while in space, they may be reprimanded._

This should not happen lightly, but if a player is behaving poorly while in space the [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master) may reprimand them. Some example punishments are:

- Weapons Restriction - You cannot go on [Deployment](Game/Deployment) with weapons until behaviour improves.
- Re-education - You do not get an [Advancement](#Advancement) instead being required to spend that time being re-educated.
- Discharge - In dire circumstances, you may need to release a character (and potentially their player) from the Reclaimers and further a play group.

## Most Valuable Reclaimer

_During your debrief notes will be taken on who stood out during the deployment. Hard work does not go unnoticed at the Reclaimers._

Every Reclaimer who departed should discuss who was the most valuable Reclaimer was during the session. You cannot nominate yourself, but should try to honour a meaningful moment, sacrifice, great role play, or other feat. The person the group determines did something outstanding gets an [Excellence](Game/Blocks/Excellence).

## Advancement

_You are expected to remain sharp while not deployed to the field, [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) provides a multitude of training programs and augmentations that you can receive._

You will gain some [Progress](Game/Progress#Progress) every time you return from space.

## Trophy

_As a Reclaimer, your gear is generally the property of [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) however as a specialized operative, you may maintain 1 piece of [Equipment](Game/Core/Equipment) that you find in space which you are allowed to deploy with._

If you brought back a unique or otherwise unavailable to yourself piece of [Equipment](Game/Core/Equipment) you may make it your trophy, an item you can select when going on [Deployment](Game/Deployment). You may only have 1 trophy, if you replace an old trophy it is lost.
