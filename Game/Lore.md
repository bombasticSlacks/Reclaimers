*Every act of creation is first an act of destruction. -Pablo Picasso*

In the future, humanity has colonized the stars. Large settlements have developed on valuable planets, utilizing a backbone of colony ships equipped with stasis technology and advanced computational systems for management over long voyages. 

Terraforming technology does not widely exist, or is prohibitively expensive, so large metal structures house colonists on planets as well as in orbit. Along with terraforming technology, most biological and medical research has fallen behind, following Artificial Intelligence and human robotics augmentation as emerging fields. This push for further augmentation of the human form led to incredible advances that made for new beings that were beyond human. Some of these superior beings rebelled.

In its want for fast expansion humanity did not have proper infrastructure in place to participate in a galactic war, so fighting has been mainly isolated with it taking weeks for messages to be received by the centralized human government and months for reinforcements and supplies to be delivered.

## Reclamation
You are a member of a reclamation squad, a [Reclaimer](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Reclaimers).

## The Rules Of The Reclaimers
1.  No Reclaimer left behind: Unless it is an emergency, Reclaimers should always travel in at least pairs. Staying together saves lives.
2.  People are the most valuable assets. Machines and subsystems can be replaced, but highly trained humans with the aptitude for space travel are difficult to come by. Prioritize their protection over anything else.
3.  Reclaimers are even more valuable assets. The only group harder to train than space fairing experts in their field are space fairing experts in their field with military training.
4.  Always look for ways to better yourself. You are valuable to the central government, and any opportunity to better yourself directly betters the government itself.
5.  Always represent the interests and attitude of the central government. You are peacekeepers and should, if possible, be careful to respect the places you go and the local customs.
