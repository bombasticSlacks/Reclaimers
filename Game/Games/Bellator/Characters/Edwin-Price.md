## Edwin Price
### Description
*A [Prole](Game/Prole) standing 5'9" with the slender frame commonly seen in those spending more time in space than on the ground. He keeps his hair cropped short to better facilitate void suits and alleviate the nuisance of free floating hair in zero-g. This function over form extends to the rest of Edwin's attire, which frequently sports [TAC-Rigging](Game/Blocks/TAC-Rigging) and repair equipment even when not on deployment. Edwin's facial features mimic his general demeanour in depicting a boyish charm, if only they were not marred by the scars of several near-death experiences. Edwin's piercing blue eyes are at odds with his effervescent smile, briefly relaying the horrors of the galaxy with which Edwin has become all too familiar.*

### Position
The primary tech for Bellator's vehicle bay and mechanized gear.
