# Additional Attributes
On top of the above attributes, your character also has a few additional values.

## Completed Missions
Tracks the number of missions you have completed, informs what [Advancements](Game/Progress#Advancements) you can select after each mission.

## Excellence
Rewarded to Reclaimers who go above and beyond the call of duty, excellence can be used to:
* Save yourself from dying. This only keeps you from death, it doesn't heal you.
* Give yourself or another person a re-roll on any [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test).
* Gain an additional point for [Requisition](Game/Deployment#Requisition).
* Gain an additional [Charge](Game/Core/Blocks/Charges) of something.
## Exhaustion
A measure of how much horror a person can see before they are no longer fit for the work. When you take your [Baseline Test](Game/Returning-From-Space#Baseline%20Test) you will gain exhaustion, when you hit your max exhaustion you will have to [Retire](Game/Progress#Retiring).

Max exhaustion is 20.

## Munition Capacity
A way to track how many supplies you can carry on you.

Munition Capacity is equal [Strength](Core/Strength) by default.

## Power
A stat tracking how many times your character can perform certain powerful abilities. Some [Advancements](Game/Progress#Advancements) will require you to expend this resource.

Your Maximum Power is equal to [Intelligence](Game/Core/Intelligence) + 1 per ability that requires power.

## Reaction
A stat spent on [Reacting](Game/Core/Reacting) to the world around you.

You have a maximum number of Reactions equal to your [Agility](Game/Core/Agility).

## Stress
A stat tracking how much [Stress](Game/Stress) you can handle before issues begin to arise. Being put in terrible situations or seeing deaths will push you towards your max stress.

Your max stress is equal to [Spirit](Core/Spirit).

## Sway
A stat tracking how much pull you have when requisitioning equipment for a mission. Effects the total quality of gear you can bring with you.

Sway is equal to [Communication](Core/Communication), but will be modified by [Severity](Deployment#Severity).
