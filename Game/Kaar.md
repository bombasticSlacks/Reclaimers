# Kaar
{: .no_toc }

Kaar ([keɪ ɑː](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)) are strange fungal humanoids from another [Earth](Game/Earth)-like planet that were elevated and integrated into human society. They have greyish green porous skin with a single cyclopean eye in the middle of an otherwise featureless "face". They have harsh voices and an imposing presence, leading some people to fear them. Furthermore, they are resilient and dutiful, with a culture heavily based around honour. Traditionally, they are used as shock troopers, miners, and labourers, but aside from bias in management, they make fine STEM workers. 

## Details
* Are taller than most humans.
* Weigh less than a human of similar size.

### Cultural Names
Kaar name themselves using the convention of: 'descriptor' 'natural object'.

> Fast Dirt, Sleepy River.

### Dialects
* [Universal](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Universal)
* Kaar Sensory, a language of nuanced chemical signals only understandable to those with heightened senses.

### Diet
Water and sunlight, or replacement nutrient paste smeared on the skin.

### Mementos and Fetishes
Kaar will sometimes carry a vial containing their namesake as a superstition.

### Reproduction And Gender
They are non-gendered fungus and reproduce through spores. Though, some Kaar will take on gendered pronouns based on their presentation in [Earth](Game/Earth) society. 

All space faring Kaar are neutered to avoid uncontrollable spreading and circulation of spores.
