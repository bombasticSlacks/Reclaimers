# Envoy
{: .no_toc }

Envoy (ɒnvɔɪ) are a race of organic automata vaguely humanoid in stature with unmoving faces appearing to be carved of stone but usually adorned with makeup and painted on features. Envoys were discovered on a massive, decrepit spaceship of unknown origin. The original explorers discovered that the ship's reactor had failed and the race responsible for the ship's creation had died out centuries ago. However, their automata servants had remained in stasis waiting for the reactor's recovery. 

Scientists called these entities Envoys, and through education on free will and autonomy, helped them to understand their place outside their creators. Now having been integrated into society, Envoys tend to be highly charming conversationalists and excellent company. Those that know them well will come to find most have a wry sense of humour and a nihilistic outlook.
