# Board Member
{: .no_toc }

A non-exhaustive list of active board members.

## Matilda Cross (she/her)
Ex-military, assault forces Reclaimer. A shorter woman with a powerlifters physique. She has severe burns on one half of her face, partially covered by a metal plate over her crown. The implants cause her short black hair to fall limply to one side, unable to grow on one half of her head. Matilda wears a plain military jumpsuit modified with compression bands above her waist. In the field, she wears an [EXO-Frame](Game/Blocks/EXO-Frame) and primarily uses a [Grav-Fist](Game/Blocks/Grav-Fist). She is sharp and to the point, her main drive is duty, and she has a dry gallows humour.
