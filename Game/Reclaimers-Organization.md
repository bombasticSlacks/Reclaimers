# Reclaimers Organization
{: .no_toc }

A government branch attached to the Navy but using mostly non-military personnel. Reclaimers are recruited in many ways, but once you are accepted you are a Reclaimer until you die or retire. You are guaranteed care and housing on Earth in your associated [Dome](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Dome), and receive outstanding training at the reclaimer facilities. 

## Facilities
The reclaimer facility is a large mix between a military base and a university campus housing great minds, research, dojos, firing ranges, art galleries and just about anything else the most talented of humanity has to offer. 

## The Board
The reclaimers are headed by a board of directors. These positions are for life and only replaced by appointment when a board member passes away. Board member vote on organization wide decisions and each maintain a personal [Squad](#Squad) which they are responsible for training, organizing, and arming.

## Squad
Reclaimers are generally placed in small groups called Squads. A squad is usually at most a few dozen people along with their support staff. This structure of a few people allows for tight bonds between squad mates and a sense of normalcy. The Reclaimers need to be mindful of the great lengths a deployed Reclaimers group can take to return to earth while in [Cryo](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#Cryo). Reclaimers will easily outlive their outside friends and family so having some relationships that age as they do is important.
