## Red Eclipse
Reported centuries ago on a small research station, the red eclipse is what the scientists described witnessing in their last log entries. Salvager reports notify that when found, they had butchered and cannibalized each other, creating horrible effigies of rotting meat to some unknown power. Since then, space travellers tend to refer to all unexplainable horrors as being the doing of the "Red Eclipse". 

There are plenty of unexplainable and horrible things in the galaxy, terrors beyond our imagination. Most aren't caused by an eclipse, but blaming it helps it to make sense.

## The Augmented
Humanity's hubris has brought about a collective of mighty artificial intelligence and their biomechanically augmented soldiers. They drift through space, attempting to disrupt humanities supply lines and infiltrating space stations. The Augmented's plans can seem ultimately inscrutable, as their warped planning rests in the hands of intelligence entirely different from our own.

## Enemies Of The State
Humans have been killing each other since we have existed, space travel hasn't reduced this occurrence. There is a large collection of factions looking to harm and disrupt [CentGov](Game/Terms-And-Jargon#CentGov) and its people.
