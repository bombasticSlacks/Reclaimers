### Large Bullets
*High calibre rifle bullets using over pressured propellant, designed for sturdy military grade weapons.*

### Dowels
*Cylindrical dowels made of depleted uranium to maximize weight.*

### Energy
*High density battery arrays can provide advanced weaponry with massive amounts of power.*

### Fuel
*Energy dense modern fuel compositions ready to be used to power horrible creations.*

### Plasma
*High-energy gas designed to burn / liquify into magnetized blasts of energy.*

### Unique
