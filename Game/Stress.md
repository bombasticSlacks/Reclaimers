# Stress
{: .no_toc }

Reclaimers deal with a massive amount of horror and strain in the field, and everyone has a boiling point. Stress behaves like [Armour](Game/Core/Armour) but for your mind, providing a buffer before you have trouble contributing and behaving rationally.

Whenever you: 
* See something horrible.
* Become afraid of something.
* Do something unethical.
* Make a hard choice.

You gain stress. 

## Regaining Stress
Resting taking a break during play isn't enough to remove stress, stress is fully removed when [Returning-From-Space](Game/Returning-From-Space), but if you do something truly heroic or absolving, your [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master) may reduce your stress.

## Boiling Over
If you, at any point, gain stress and have stress equal to or greater than your boiling point, you are no longer useful to the scene. The [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master) and [Player Characters](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character) may come up with a unique result or effect for the stress and how it manifests, but as a fallback, it is like the character is [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated).
