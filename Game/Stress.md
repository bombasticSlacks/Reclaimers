# Stress
{: .no_toc }

Reclaimers deal with a massive amount of horror and strain in the field, and everyone has a [Boiling Point](Game/Additional-Attributes#Boiling%20Point). Stress behaves like [Armour](Game/Core/Armour) but for your mind, providing a buffer before you have trouble contributing and behaving rationally.

Whenever you see something horrible, become afraid of something, do something unethical or make a hard choice, you gain stress. If you do something truly heroic or absolving, you lose stress.

## Boiling Over
If you, at any point, gain stress and have stress equal to or greater than your boiling point, you are no longer useful to the scene. The [GM](Game/Core/How-To-Play#GM) and [The Players](Game/Core/How-To-Play#The%20Players) may come up with a unique result or effect for the stress and how it manifests, but as a fallback, it is like the character is [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated).
